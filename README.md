Live Code: 
# How It's Made:
### Tech used: 

**HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

To prepare for this project I wrote up some psuedo code and prepared the HTML. This project was more JavaScript heavy because I implemented if statements for the zodiac signs along with conditionals for the dates. As well as two other functions that displayed the results and title. I had fun with CSS and experimented with gif and image stacking.

# Lessons Learned:

Adding classes to CSS through JavaScript was a new process for me. I applied it to the greeting text on the site and when the user presses the enter button to reveal their horoscope. Also, learned how to target innerHTML in JS to add images.

# Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
